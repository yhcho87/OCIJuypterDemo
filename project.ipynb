    "\n",
    "Projects are collaborative workspaces for organizing and documenting Data Science assets such as notebook sessions and models. Fundamentally, a project is a container to store these Data Science assets and the notebook sessions that are used for interactive coding. Each notebook must belong to one and only one project, but a project can have many notebooks. With the use of Identity and Access Management (IAM), restrictions on who can view, modify and delete notebooks. This allows for easy, safe and secure sharing of Data Science work products. Projects can also be used as an effective method for tracking expenses with the use of *CostCenter* tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two libraries for interacting with the project API and Python. They are the `data_science` module of the `oci` library and the Accelerated Data Science (ADS) library `ads.catalog.project`. The `data_science` module is more flexible but requires a deeper knowledge of the API system. The `ads.catalog.project` library has been developed for use by data scientists as it simplifies many of the operations that they would want to perform. Both libraries can be used together.\n",
