    "In exploratory data analysis (EDA) the data scientist uses plots and statistics to summarize the characteristics of the data. The feature type system, in the ADS library, has been designed to speed up this process. The feature type system allows data scientists to separate the concept of how data is represented physically from what the data actually measures. The data can have feature types that classify the data based on what it represents and not how the data is stored in memory. In doing so, a feature type can have a set of built-in summary statistics and a plot. This notebook demonstrates how to use feature type plots and summary statistics in your EDA.\n",
