    "The feature type system allows the data scientist to separate the concept of how data is represented physically from what the data actually measures. The data can have feature types that classify the data based on what it represents and not how the data is stored in memory. Each feature can have multiple feature types through a system of multiple inheritances. For example, an organization that sells cars might have a set of data that represents their purchase price of a car (the wholesale price). This could have a feature set of `wholesale_price`, `car_price`, `USD`, and `continuous`. This multiple inheritance allows a data scientist to create <a href=\"#warnings\">feature type warnings</a> for each feature type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature type warnings are used for rapid validation of the data. For example, the `wholesale_price` might have a method that ensures that the value is a positive number because you can't purchase a car with negative money. The `car_price` feature type might have a check to ensure that it is within a reasonable price range. `USD` can check the value to make sure that it represents a valid US dollar amount and it isn't below one cent. The `continuous` feature type is the default type, and it represents the way the data is stored internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature type validators are a set of `is_*` methods, where `*` is generally the name of the feature type. For example, the method `.is_wholesale_price()`can create a boolean Pandas series that indicates what values meet the validation criteria. It allows you to quickly identify which values need to be filtered or require future examination into problems in the data pipeline. The feature type validators can be as complex as they need to be. For example, they might take a client ID and call an API to validate each client ID is active.\n",

    "Pandas dtypes are physical data types that indicate how data are stored. You can call `.dtype` on your Pandas dataframe or series to inspect the physical types. Feature types are the logical types that define how the data should be interpreted by the end user. Feature types categorize the features from the machine learning perspective. Different feature types could be the same physical type. For example, both categorical and ordinal can be an integer dtype. However, the difference between `categorical` and `ordinal` feature types is that `ordinal` features have an ordering while `categorical` features don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADS allows a set of data to have multiple feature types through a system of inheritance. For example, a hospital may have a medical record number for each patient. That data might have the feature types `patient_id`, `id`, and `integer`. The `patient_id` is the child feature type with `id` being its parent. The `integer` is the parent of the `id` feature type. It is also the last feature type in the inheritance chain and is called the default feature type.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the regular feature types, there are two special versions. The default type is based on the Pandas dtype and cannot be changed without changing the Pandas dtype. There is no need to set it because it is always the last feature type in the inheritance chain. The tag feature type does not support feature type warning nor feature type validators. It is designed to allow you to tag data with extra information.\n",
