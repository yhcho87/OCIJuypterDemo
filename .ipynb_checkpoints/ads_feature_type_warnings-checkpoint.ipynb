    "\n",
    "Feature type warnings are part of the feature type system in ADS. It allows you to automate the process of checking for data quality issues. One of the most time-consuming processes of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) step is examining the data to make sure that it meets data quality standards. Historically, this has been a manual process and when the existing data is updated or a new dataset is used, the process has to be repeated. The feature type warning infrastructure allows you to code checks on the data and then repeat the process each time a new dataset is used. Since the code is at the feature type level, it is possible to reuse the feature type warnings across an entire organization's data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature type warning system works across an entire feature. For example, you can check for the number of missing values and set a threshold on what is the permitted upper limit. This can be a count, percentage, or some other metric. You can also create mechanisms where you check to ensure that the data has the distribution that is assumed by the model class that you want to use. For example, linear regression assumes that the data is normally distributed. Therefore, the feature type warning might have a Shapiro-Wilk test and a threshold for what is an expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each feature can have as many feature type warnings as you want. Also, the multiple inheritance nature of the feature type system allows you to write-only the feature type warnings that are relevant for that specific feature type because the warnings for all inherited feature types to be checked. This feature reduces the amount of code duplication and speeds up your EDA.\n",

    "# Feature Type System\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature type system allows the data scientist to separate the concept of how data is represented physically from what the data actually measures. The data can have feature types that classify the data based on what it represents and not how the data is stored in memory. Each feature can have multiple feature types through a system of multiple inheritances. For example, an organization that sells cars might have a set of data that represents their purchase price of a car (the wholesale price). This could have a feature set of `wholesale_price`, `car_price`, `USD`, and `continuous`. This multiple inheritance allows a data scientist to create <a href=\"#warnings\">feature type warnings</a> for each feature type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature type warnings are used for rapid validation of the data. For example, the `wholesale_price` might have a method that ensures that the value is a positive number because you can't purchase a car with negative money. The `car_price` feature type might have a check to ensure that it is within a reasonable price range. `USD` can check the value to make sure that it represents a valid US dollar amount and it isn't below one cent. The `continuous` feature type is the default type, and it represents the way the data is stored internally.\n",

    "# Feature Type Warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to check the state or condition of your data. This is checking to ensure that there are no missing values.  With categorical data, you often want to ensure that the cardinality is low enough for the type of modeling that you are doing. Since the feature type system is meant to understand the nature of your data, and is an ideal mechanism to help automate the evaluation of the data. This evaluation is done by registering feature type warnings handlers with ADS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature type warning handlers are functions that are built-in or user-defined. They perform an analysis of a feature to determine whether there are any data condition problems. For example, it might report that a feature is skewed when the expectation is that the data is normally distributed. Another common example is that the data might have more than some threshold of missing values. ADS comes with various common warnings built-in for the feature types that it supports. However, you are able to create and register any warnings that you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature type warnings are defined at the feature type level. Warnings can be registered dynamically at runtime. The `feature_type_manager.warning_registered()` shows a dataframe of registered warnings of each registered feature type. The three columns of the returned dataframes are:\n",
