    "\n",
    "* Provides data scientists with a collaborative, project-driven workspace.\n",
    "* Enables self-service access to infrastructure for data science workloads.\n",
    "* Includes Python-centric tools, libraries, and packages developed by the open-source community and the [Oracle Accelerated Data Science Library](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/ads-sdk/latest/index.html), which supports the end-to-end lifecycle of predictive models:\n",

The MNE [tutorials](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/index.html) cover many of the common tasks that this conda environment was designed for.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. `Gumpy`:\n",
    "    Gumpy implements tooling used in the collection and analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) data. It empowers researchers to quickly perform data analysis and implement novel classifiers. The combination of EEG and EMG makes it especially powerful for the development of hybrid brain-computer interfaces (BCI). It is also designed for extensibility so that you can customize it for your specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Gumpy comes with the following modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Dataset: Read Graz 2b, the recorded EEG and EMG dataset, and create new datasets by subclassing gumpy.dataset.Dataset.\n",
    "    * Signal processing: Process EEG and EMG signals by filtering, normalizing, and much more.\n",
    "    * Plotting: Create data visualizations that are specific to EEG and EMG data, such as discrete wavelet approximations, PCA and more.\n",
    "    * Feature extraction: Extract features from EMG and EEG signals.\n",
    "    * Classification:  Machine learning classifiers such as SVM, LDA, KNN, LDA with shrinkage, MLP, Random Forest, Logistic regression Quadratic LDA\n",
